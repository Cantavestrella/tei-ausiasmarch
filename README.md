Conversion from LaTEX format to TEI-XML of a synoptic diplomatic edition, according to all witnesses, of the poetry corpus of the 15-c. Valencian poet Ausiàs March who wrote in Catalan.
All TEI-XML documents in this repository are the transformed result work from a previous LaTEX format version out of the synoptic
diplomatic edition of the complete poemes of Ausiàs March in all its witnesses, first undertaken by a research Valencian team by the
universities of Alacant and Politècnica de València, coordinated by Professor Llúcia Martín Pascual (https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0188-7726) as IP. 
From this original philological work in LaTEX, a subsequent Universitat de València research group, coordinated by Professor 
Rosanna Cantavella (https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4424-3659) is undertaking a transformation into XML-based Text Encoding Initiative, so that 
Ausiàs March's poetry corpus can be machine read and mined.
All documents are open access, in licence CC-BY.
